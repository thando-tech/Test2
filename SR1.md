# SR1 Data Sourcing

## Dataset Information
- Source: Zenodo
- Dataset Title: "Dataset on Informal Settlements"
- Link: [Dataset on Informal Settlements](https://zenodo.org/records/10108284)
- Format: CSV

## Justification for Suitability

The dataset from Zenodo is highly suitable for analyzing informal settlements for several reasons:

1. Credibility:
   - Zenodo is a reputable open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It provides a reliable platform for sharing research data, ensuring that the dataset is credible and trustworthy.

2. Relevance:
   - The dataset is specifically focused on informal settlements, making it directly relevant to the theme. It is expected to contain information that addresses various aspects of informal settlements, such as demographics, living conditions, infrastructure, and possibly the socioeconomic factors influencing these areas.

3. Data Completeness:
   - This dataset is comprehensive and well-documented, which indicates that it includes extensive data on informal settlements. The completeness of the data ensures that it can be used for thorough analysis and drawing meaningful insights.

4. Columns of Interest:
   - Settlement Name: This column is essential as it identifies the specific informal settlement. It is crucial for geographically mapping and analyzing different settlements individually.
   - Population Density: This column provides insights into the density of people living in each informal settlement. High population density often correlates with overcrowded living conditions, which is a significant factor in understanding the challenges faced by residents of informal settlements.

These columns, among others, will allow us to perform detailed analysis on how various factors such as population density affect the living conditions in informal settlements. By leveraging this dataset, we can gain insights into the dynamics of informal settlements and potentially identify areas for improvement or intervention.
