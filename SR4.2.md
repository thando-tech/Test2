Linear Search Algorithm
Description: A linear search algorithm sequentially checks each element of a list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Performance:
Advantages: Simple to implement and works well with small to moderately sized lists. Does not require the list to be sorted.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for large lists because it checks each element one by one.


Binary Search Algorithm
Description: A binary search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted list. It repeatedly divides the list in half and compares the target value with the middle element, eliminating half of the remaining elements from consideration each time.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
Performance:
Advantages: Much faster than linear search for large lists due to its logarithmic time complexity. Efficient for large datasets.
Disadvantages: Requires the list to be sorted before searching.



Comparison
Speed: Binary search is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets. This is because binary search reduces the search space by half with each comparison, whereas linear search examines each element sequentially.
Use Cases:
Linear Search: Suitable for small or unsorted datasets where simplicity is preferred.
Binary Search: Ideal for large, sorted datasets where performance is critical.
