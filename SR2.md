### Data Types in Machine Learning Context

In this dataset, columns can be of various types such as:
- Numerical: These are continuous values that represent some measurable quantity. In machine learning, numerical data can be used directly for algorithms that require numeric input. For example, the column `Age` might be a numerical feature.
- Categorical: These columns contain discrete values that represent categories. Machine learning algorithms require these to be encoded into numerical values (e.g., using one-hot encoding). For example, the column `Gender` might be a categorical feature.

Here is an example using the `Age` column:
- **Column Name**: `Age`
- **Data Type**: Numerical (int64)
- **Usage in Machine Learning**: This feature can be directly used in regression models or as a part of feature engineering in classification models. Standardization or normalization might be applied to scale this feature.
